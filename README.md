#Description:
This Python program implements a Spam Email Detection system using Scikit-learn. It loads a dataset of labeled messages, preprocesses the text using TF-IDF vectorization, and trains a Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) emails. The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Additionally, a function is provided to predict whether any new message is spam or ham.

#Additional Suggestions (Optional)
*Add .strip() and .lower() in predict_email() for better normalization.
*Add error handling for empty email predictions.
